      Hello there, my name is Sam and I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for front end
      development. I've been learning web development since 2013 where things looked a lot different
      than they do today. I aspire to always work with something that brings me joy and have a hand
      in making a better web experience through beautiful software and engaging web experiences. My
      other passions are playing video or board games, listening to audio books, cycling, playing
      and going on hikes with my dog, and traveling to some of the most beautiful places on earth.
