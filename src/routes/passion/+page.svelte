      <p>
        Finding a common wording and direction that can help all of the web pieces together. Every
        part of the web process has their own mind and being able to speak to each of them brings
        product managers, clients, and developers closer together.

      <h4 class="h4 text-center mb-2">Development</h4>
      <p>
        With a strong foundation in several programming languages and methodologies, I've found a
        focus and joy working in the front end. Working full stack allows me to find satisfaction in
        making everything come together and work fast!

      <!-- learn and guide -->
      <p>
        Learning from others and trying to help others learn, which never ends in development. For
        self education I enjoy attending conferences, meetups, and other events. Mentoring
        developers personally and professionally brings me joy and fulfillment.
